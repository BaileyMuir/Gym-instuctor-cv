        <p>Welcome to my website. My name is Bailey. I am a trained gym instructor. I have worked in and around the fitness industry for two years, where I held the position of recreational assistantâ€”this involved day to day tasks such as.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily cleaning of the premises.</li>
            <li>Working in and around the gym by cleaning the equipment and ensuring everything is back where it needs to be to avoid trip hazards.</li>
            <li>I was working around the pool-side, where I was placed in charge of the waterslide and maintained an emergency button in the event of someone drowning.</li>
            <li>I worked in the creche and play area, looking after the kids and ensuring they were safe while their parents were away.</li>
            <li>I was trained to set up the hall for classes and the trampolines for relevant lessons and parties.</li>
            <li>I filled in the relevant forms to comply with RIDDOR and other applicable legislation on a few occasions.</li>
        </ul>
